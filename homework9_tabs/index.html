        <!-- Akali -->
        <li class="tab-panel one">
          Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali
          now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need.
          Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has
          pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali
          may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear:
          fear the assassin with no maste
        </li>
        <!-- Anivia -->
        <li class="tab-panel two">
          Anivia is a benevolent winged spirit who endures endless cycles of
          life, death, and rebirth to protect the Freljord. A demigod born of
          unforgiving ice and bitter winds, she wields those elemental powers to
          thwart any who dare disturb her homeland. Anivia guides and protects
          the tribes of the harsh north, who revere her as a symbol of hope, and
          a portent of great change. She fights with every ounce of her being,
          knowing that through her sacrifice, her memory will endure, and she
          will be reborn into a new tomorrow.
        </li>
        <!--Draven -->
        <li class="tab-panel three">
          In Noxus, warriors known as reckoners face one another in arenas where
          blood is spilled and strength tested—but none has ever been as
          celebrated as Draven. A former soldier, he found that the crowds
          uniquely appreciated his flair for the dramatic, not to mention the
          spray of blood from each of his spinning axes. Addicted to the
          spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat
          whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the
          empire forever more.
        </li>
        <!-- Garen -->
        <li class="tab-panel four">
          A proud and noble soldier, Garen fights at the head of the Dauntless
          Vanguard. He is popular among his fellows, and respected well enough
          by his enemies—not least as a scion of the prestigious Crownguard
          family, entrusted with defending Demacia and its ideals. Clad in
          magic-resistant armor and bearing a mighty broadsword, Garen stands
          ready to confront mages and sorcerers on the field of battle, in a
          veritable whirlwind of righteous steel.
        </li>
        <!-- Katarina -->
        <li class="tab-panel five">
          Decisive in judgment and lethal in combat, Katarina is a Noxian
          assassin of the highest caliber. Eldest daughter to the legendary
          General Du Couteau, she made her talents known with swift kills
          against unsuspecting enemies. Her fiery ambition has driven her to
          pursue heavily-guarded targets, even at the risk of endangering her
          allies—but no matter the mission, Katarina will not hesitate to
          execute her duty amid a whirlwind of serrated daggers.
